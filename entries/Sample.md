HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language used to create web pages. It provides the basic structure of a webpage, allowing developers to define elements like headings, paragraphs, links, images, and more. HTML works alongside CSS and JavaScript to create visually appealing and interactive websites. It is a fundamental technology for building the web and is continuously evolving to support new features and improve user experience. With HTML, developers can craft well-organized and accessible content that can be displayed across various devices and browsers.
